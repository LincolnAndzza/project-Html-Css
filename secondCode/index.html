      Users with paragraphs 1 : Taylor Lautner s Jacob Black and his clan have
      been shape-shifting into wolves since the second film in Summit's Twilight
      series. But for Breaking Dawn Part 2, Tippett Studio introduced its most
      complex work to date on these characters. Here, the VFX house behind films
      from Hellboy to Enchanted gives THR an exclusive look behind the scenes.
      During the Twilight Saga, we hear about a phenomenon that happens among
      werewolves known as "imprinting". In the last book/film of the franchise,
      we even see Jacob Black imprinting with none other than Renesmee, daughter
      of Bella and Edward
